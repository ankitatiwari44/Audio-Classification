# Audio-Classification

Audio classification is the process of analyzing and identifying any type of audio, sound, noise, musical notes, or any other similar type of data to classify them accordingly. The audio data that is available to us can occur in numerous forms, such as sound from acoustic devices, musical chords from instruments, human speech, or even naturally occurring sounds like the chirping of birds in the environment. Modern deep learning techniques allow us to achieve state-of-the-art results for tasks and projects related to audio signal processing.
